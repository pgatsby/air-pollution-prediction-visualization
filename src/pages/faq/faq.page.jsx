            The most common air pollutants in Los Angeles are particulate
            matter, ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur
            oxides.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Particulate Matter</strong>
            <br />
            Particulate matter refers to a mixture of extremely small solid
            particles suspended in liquid droplets. They vary significantly in
            composition and size. They are generated by cars and trucks,
            fireplaces, woodstoves, as well as windblown dust from roadways,
            agriculture, and construction.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Ozone</strong>
            <br />
            Ozone is created when sunlight strikes nitrogen oxides found in the
            air and because sunlight is brightest during the summer, ozone
            becomes a particular problem around this time of year. Common causes
            of ozone include cars, trucks, buses, and power plants.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Lead</strong>
            <br />
            Lead is a metal that occurs naturally in soil and rock but a variey
            of human activities release lead into the environment. Current major
            sources of lead include industrial processes such as ore and metal
            processing as well as non-road equipment that utilize
            lead-containing fuel such as recreational vehicles, farm and
            construction machinery, lawn and garden equipment, boats, and
            trains.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Carbon Monoxide</strong>
            <br />
            Carbon monoxide is a gas that forms when fossil fuels are burned.
            Motor vehicles are the largest source of carbon monoxide emissions
            but other major sources include non-road equipment as well as fires.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Nitrogen Oxides</strong>
            <br />
            Nitrogen oxides are a group of gases that are regulated by the EPA.
            The leading contributor to nitrogen oxide emissions are cars,
            trucks, and non-road equipment.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Sulfur Oxides</strong>
            <br />
            Sulfur oxides are a group of gases that are regulated by the EPA.
            Main sources of sulfur dioxide emissions include power plants and
            industrial facilities.

            <strong>Particulate Matter</strong>
            <br />
            Exposure to particulate pollutants affect both the heart and the
            lungs. It has been linked to respiratory symptoms and for those with
            asthma, it can aggravate symptoms of their disease. For individuals
            with heart disease, it raises their risk of a heart attack.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Ozone</strong>
            <br />
            Exposure to ozone can damage lung function as well as trigger a
            varity of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat
            irritation and congestion, as well as aggravate lung diseases such
            as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Lead</strong>
            <br />
            Exposure to lead can cause levels in the blood to rise and trigger a
            host of harmful effects. Elevated lead levels can cause symptoms
            such as irritability, fatigue, loss of appetite and headache. For
            infants and young children, it can lead to behavioral problems and
            learning deficits.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Carbon Monoxide</strong>
            <br />
            When carbon monoxide is inhaled, it attches to hemoglobin, a
            substance that carries oxygen to cells throughout the body,
            preventing blood from carry adequate amounts of oxygen. This can
            cause headaches and fatigue while individuals with heart disease may
            suffer chest pain.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Nitrogen Oxides</strong>
            <br />
            Breathing in high levels of nitrogen dioxide can cause symptoms such
            as coughing and wheezing and it also impairs the body's ability to
            fight off infections. Exposure to elevated levels of this pollutant
            may be more susceptible to develop colds and bronchitis.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Sulfur Oxides</strong>
            <br />
            Exposure to sulfur dioxide can cause nose, throat and airway
            irritation, coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of
            breath. Individuals with asthma and other chronic respiratory
            diseases are at greatest risk of developing problems.

            Los Angeles plans to expand and improve their public transportation
            systems, which has taken environmentally friendly steps by using
            more fuel efficient vehicles as well as utilizing renewable energy
            and facilities, to make it accessible to all residents. Los Angeles
            has also called for the elimination of diesel trucks which has known
            to cause health problems. Los Angeles has also laid out a roadmap to
            accelerate the transition of privately owned cars and trucks to
            electric vehicles which will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions as
            well as significantly improve air quality. Lastly, Los Angeles plans
            to conserve more carbon-capturing parks and forests.
